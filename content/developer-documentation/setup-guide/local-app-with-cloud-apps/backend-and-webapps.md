## Using the Cloud Backend

The backend is AWS-hosted and can be used with both local Docker and Flutter app deployments. Using the cloud backend eliminates local setup complexity.

## Using the Cloud Webapps

For testing with the cloud backend, use the cloud-deployed web applications:
- Tenant Admin Console: For device management and configuration
- Dashboard: For monitoring and analytics

See the *User Documentation* for detailed usage instructions. Contact an administrator if you need login credentials.
