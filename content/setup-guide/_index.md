## Welcome to the KatApp Setup Guide!

This guide explains the process of setting up the KatApp environment for local usage. Navigate through the steps on the sidebar to set up the environment according to your needs.

For regular users this setup is already complete, visit the **User Documentation** for further guidance.

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) strongly simplifies the setup process. Because of this, it is recommended to install the application before following this guide.

In case you are working from within an organization: Docker Desktop requires a license under certain organizational conditions. This license may need to be requested at the corresponding IT help desk. Alternatively, use [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/). This is an open-source alternative which allows access to the Docker CLI and containerization.
