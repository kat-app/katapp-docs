## Using the Cloud Backend

The backend is deployed on AWS. This deployment can be used from within a local App deployment via Docker or Flutter. Using the deployed backend simplifies setup.

## Using the Cloud Webapps

When using the cloud deployed backend, also use the cloud deployed Webapps for testing. Follow the *User Documentation* to learn more about the use of the Tenant Admin Console and Dashboard. If the logins for these have not yet been provided to you, ask for these credentials.
