The Home page provides an initial overview map with your current location marked as a pin.

You can use the dialog at the top right to:
- Jump to the nearest available disaster
- Jump back to your current location
- Select a start time to filter for relevant disasters

You can go to a disaster by:
- Jumping to the nearest available disaster
- Moving the map manually and searching for another available disaster

After you've found the relevant disaster, you can click on the icon which will open a popup with basic information 
about the disaster.
By clicking 'Select', you can enter the Selected Disaster Overview page for this disaster.
See the documentation for the Selected Disaster Overview page [here](/selecteddisasteroverview).

If several disasters are very close to each other they are clustered and a cluster icon with the number of clustered
disasters is shown instead:
