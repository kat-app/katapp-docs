The Registration page allows you to register for access to the KatApp Dashboard.

If you're already registered, you can click the link at the top to go to the Login page.
See the documentation for the Login page [here](/login).

You have to fill in all fields of the form. 
Only if all fields contain valid values, the button 'Register' will be enabled.

You will be forwarded to the Login page once the registration was completed successfully and a success message will be 
shown at the bottom left of the page.

Your user has to be activated by an admin before you can log in to the KatApp Dashboard.

You can also use the available action items in the header. 
See the documentation for the Header Action Items [here](/headeractionitems).
