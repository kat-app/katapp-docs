On this screen you'll find a overview of all your triages during a disaster.

According to our data privacy you only see your own triages on the screen which are stored locally on your device during the disaster. 

To view the full triage history of a patient you need to scan the QR-Code of the patient.

### Offline Triages

If there are any pending offline triages (triages that are not yet uploaded to the server) you can indetify those triages by the 'no connection' icon.
As soon as the background service succesfully uploaded the triage to the server the icon will disappear.

### Clearing

All triages on this screen will get cleared if you start a triage of another disaster or at the latest after 12 hours.
