## Get the App

To install the app on Android you need a direct invitation link via email. The mail is send by your supervisor.
The email looks as similar as below with a download link containing the latest build.

The email contains also an installation link for the Firebase App Tester application.

It is highly recommended to install the Firebase App Tester application, as it makes the download and management of the different app versions much easier. The app lists the different versions currently available at one place and providing the same download link as with the email. sAlways select the latest version unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Once you click on the download link, an apk file will be downloaded. You need to open and install it on your device. All the asked permissions must be granted for installing the app successfully on your device.

After successfully installing the KatApp you will find the KatApp logo on your home screen.
