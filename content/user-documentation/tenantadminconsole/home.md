After successfully logged in, the home page is the first page you see.

It has the permament menu list opened on the left-hand side as all pages do (see [Navigation](/navigation)).
The Home page has different cards giving you a quick access to different information.

**Tenant Overview:** 
- The Tenant Overview Card shows the number of not activated users within the tenant organisation. You can directly see that and jump to the User activation page for activating those users.
- The Tenant Overview Card shows additionally the currently registered devices within the tenant organisation. That is just a interesting number to notice at the entry point of the Tenant Admin Console. You can also jump directly to the Device manage page to administrate those devices.

**Personal Profile:**
- The Personal Profile shows the most important personal data of the currently logged in admin. Here you quickly notice that you are correctly logged in with your own profile. A click on the overall profile opens up a drawer with even more admin information.
