The Login page is the entrypoint to the KatApp Tenant Admin Console. 

If you're already registered and your user was activated by the KatApp Operator, you can log in using your e-mail address and password you used for registration.
Otherwise, you can click the link below the login button to navigate to the [Registration page](/adminRegistration).

As soon as the log in was successful, you will be redirected to the [Home page](/home).
