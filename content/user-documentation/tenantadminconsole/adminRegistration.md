The Registration page allows you to register for access to the Tenant Admin Console.

You have to fill in all fields of the form. 
Only if all fields contain valid values, the button 'Register' will be enabled.
Please notice that you need to choose between the different Tenants. Only one Tenant can be selected.

Your user has to be activated by the KatApp Operator before you can log in to the Tenant Admin Console.

As soon as the registration was successful, you will be redirected to the [Login Page](/login).
