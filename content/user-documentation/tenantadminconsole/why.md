Hospitals that want to implement the system in disaster medicine do not want to set up their own infrastructure. The tenancy model is therefore designed so that they can use the operator's existing infrastructure (currently Clinic TÃ¼bingen), but have to pay for its use. As you can see below, once Tenants pay for the KatApp ecosystem, all provided interfaces such as the KatApp-app, KatApp-dashboard, KatApp-backend and the KatApp-tenant-admin-console are availabe to them.

For working with the KatApp ecosystem, ressources such as devices and users needs to be registered and activated. Additionally these resources have roles that give them certain access rights. The Tenant Admin Console is a web application that allows the tenant administrator to create and manage these resources in order for them to be able to work with the KatApp App and KatApp Dashboard.

These [services](/services) are currently available in the Tenant Admin Console.
